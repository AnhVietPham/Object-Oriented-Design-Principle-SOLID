# Object Oriented Design Principle-SOLID
## Requirements
* Install Jdk from oracle website.
* Understand the basics of loops and conditionals.
* Basic understanding of one programming language.
## Description.
This project will use Java Language. LEARN-BY-DOING approach to explore a series of progressively challenging exercises to discover the 5 core oject oriented design PRINCIPLES which summarized by an acronym called SOLID:
* (S). Single Responsibility.
* (O). Open/Closed.
* (L). Liskov Substitution.
* (l). Interface Segregation.
* (D). Dependency Inversion.
### Applying some of the most important DESIGN PATTERN:
* 1). Strategy Pattern.
* 2). Observer Pattern.
* 3). Builder pattern.
* 4). Factory method pattern.
* 5). Template Method Pattern.
* 6). Singleton Pattern.
## Who this project is for:
* If you've had trouble creating java programs that contain more than 1 or 2 classes, this course is for you.
* If you're afraid to show your code to senior developers, you MUST take this project.
* If you want to design well constructed software this project is for you
